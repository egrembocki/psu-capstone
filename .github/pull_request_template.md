## Jira Story Link
[HTMRL-###](https://psu-capstone.atlassian.net/browse/HTMRL-###)

## Summary

<!--
Provide a brief summary of what this PR is designed to address (the "why" more than the "what"). Yes, this should be captured in the Jira link above but the more places we have details and logic flow, the better. If applicable, also provide reproducibility steps, important context, etc.

Example:

Currently, errors in the SDR encoder are not wrapped. Raw errors are sent back up the callstack. This is not ideal since it does provide a callstack for us and makes it more difficult to determine where in the logic the error is taking place. This PR updates the logic in the SDR encoder method to better wrap errors before returning them up the callstack
-->

## Bump version
Use tags for the version bump. `version:major`, `version:minor`, or `version:patch`
<!-- https://semver.org/ -->

# Dependencies
<!--
If applicable, link to any other PRs this PR depends upon and why.

Example:

- [HTMRL-###](https://psu-capstone.atlassian.net/browse/HTMRL-###): We need to wait on this PR so the basic implementation for error wrapping is in place first.

## Testing performed

### Summary

<!--
Provide a high-level summary of test results from the procedures outlined below, if applicable
-->

### How was this tested

<!--
Include a detailed description of testing steps performed
-->

## Screenshots

<!--

## Tech debt this creates

<!--
NOTE: If you need to put something here, you must create a story or task in JIRA that captures the work needed to be done to resolve this tech debt so that we do not lose track of it

If applicable, a description of any tech debt created as a result of this PR's merge.

Example:
These changes ended up with instances where error wrapping is not being done in a consistent way across all calls in the repo. Ideally we want everything to be consistent

This is captured in https://psu-capstone.atlassian.net/browse/HTMRL-###
