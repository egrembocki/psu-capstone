"""Base class for all encoders -- from NuPic Numenta Cpp ported to python.
/**
 * Base class for all encoders.
 * An encoder converts a value to a sparse distributed representation.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement method encode and Serializable interface.
 * Subclasses can optionally implement method reset.
 *
 * There are several critical properties which all encoders must have:
 *
 * 1) Semantic similarity:  Similar inputs should have high overlap.  Overlap
 * decreases smoothly as inputs become less similar.  Dissimilar inputs have
 * very low overlap so that the output representations are not easily confused.
 *
 * 2) Stability:  The representation for an input does not change during the
 * lifetime of the encoder.
 *
 * 3) Sparsity: The output SDR should have a similar sparsity for all inputs and
 * have enough active bits to handle noise and subsampling.
