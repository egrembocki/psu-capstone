# Constants (Spatial Pooler)
CONNECTED_PERM = 0.5  # Permanence threshold for an input synapse to be considered connected
MIN_OVERLAP = 3       # Minimum overlap to be considered during inhibition
PERMANENCE_INC = 0.01 #
PERMANENCE_DEC = 0.01 #
DESIRED_LOCAL_ACTIVITY = 10 #

# Constants (Temporal Memory)
SEGMENT_ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD = 3   # Active connected distal synapses required for a segment to be active (prediction)
SEGMENT_LEARNING_THRESHOLD = 3     # Subset used to select best matching segment
INITIAL_DISTAL_PERM = 0.21         # Initial permanence for new distal synapses
NEW_SYNAPSE_MAX = 6                # New synapses to add when reinforcing a learning segment

We probably want our own protocol for finding these values.
