"""
Test suite for OutputField class.

OutputField represents motor/motor-like outputs that the HTM can control.
It works with ColumnField predictions to generate motor commands.

Key Features:
  - Receives predictions from ColumnField
  - Executes motor actions based on learned patterns
  - Tracks action history and success metrics
  - Supports learning from environmental feedback

Parameter Requirements:
  - size: number of output bits
  - motor_action: action specification (tuple of action parameters)
  - Tests must provide both parameters (recent code change)

Tests validate:
  1. OutputField initialization with required parameters
  2. Action execution from prediction inputs
  3. Feedback integration for learning
  4. Output format consistency
  5. Multi-field motor coordination
